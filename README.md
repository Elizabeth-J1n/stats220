## A Little About Me:

1. I am undertaking a degree in *Psychology*.
2. I am taking **STATS 220** because stats is useful in so many areas of life and work.
3. I am interested in learning about the patterns and cool codes that keep lectures interesting.

## Things I Enjoy During My Spare Time:

- Reading online books on [NovelUpdates](https://www.novelupdates.com/).
